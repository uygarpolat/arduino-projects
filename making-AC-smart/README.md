This ESP8266 project turns your “dumb,” RF-controlled air conditioner into a smart one! I mean, it did for mine, but your mileage may vary depending on your unit’s RF frequency, as you’ll need to sniff your remote’s radio signal first to discover the on/off codes and operating frequency, which may or may not be possible via a [transceiver module](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-wireless-communication-nrf24l01-tutorial/).

It uses a NodeMCU (ESP8266) board, a DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor, a 433 MHz RF transmitter module, and the Blynk app for remote monitoring and control. When the room temperature climbs above your set threshold, the ESP8266 sends your AC’s ON code; when it falls below the lower threshold, it sends the OFF code. You can also toggle it manually via the Blynk app, and even push firmware updates over the air with ArduinoOTA.
