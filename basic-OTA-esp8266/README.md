# ESP8266 OTA Example

A minimal Arduino sketch that enables over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates for ESP8266 modules. After updating one too many sketch via USB, I decided to set up an OTA template for my ESP8266 projects so that I can update them wirelessly without needing to connect them to my computer every time, irrespctive of the location of the module, as long as it is connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

This example is a simple starting point to get you going in your projects. Just start with this template and add your own code.

Edit the `STASSID` and `STAPSK` macros in the sketch with your network credentials.
